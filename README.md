sentiment analysis in chatgpt dataset
Sentiment analysis of tweets about ChatGPT provides valuable insights into public perception and sentiment toward this innovative AI technology. By analyzing tweets mentioning ChatGPT, researchers can gauge user satisfaction, identify potential areas for improvement, and understand how individuals interact with and perceive AI-driven chatbots. 
Moreover, integrating an **opinion lexicon** into sentiment analysis enhances the depth of analysis by providing a reference for sentiment polarity. The opinion lexicon, a curated list of words categorized by their sentiment orientation, allows sentiment analysis algorithms to assign sentiment scores to tweets based on the presence of positive or negative keywords. By combining sentiment analysis with the opinion lexicon, researchers can gain a nuanced understanding of the sentiment expressed in tweets about ChatGPT, enabling organizations to tailor their strategies and offerings to better meet user needs and preferences
